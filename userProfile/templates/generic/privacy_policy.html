    What information we collect from you
</h3>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4>
    In General.
</h4>
<p>
    We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal
    information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name and password. We may also request information
    about your purchase intentions, what you wish to buy, which online stores you visit etc. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general
    some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able
    to post store reviews, participate in discussions, e-mail Wishradio.in content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and online
    shopping, and enter surveys &amp; contests. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question, provide feedback or
    initiate other transactions on our site.
</p>
<h4>
    Information About Others.
</h4>
<p>
    You will have the opportunity to provide contact information for other people through our Web site. You should obtain the consent of other individuals
    prior to providing Wishradio.in with their personal information.
</p>
<h4>
    Information from Other Sources.
</h4>
<p>
    We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent
    third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit Wishradio.in by "clicking-through" from a site operated by one of
    our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us,
    such as information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Web
    site or before coming to our Web site, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through
    those services in order to improve and personalize your use of our Web site.
</p>
<h4>
    Automatic Collection of Information.
</h4>
<p>
    We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Wishradio.in. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP
    address, Web browser software, and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed and pages
    visited. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests of our users and customize your user experience.
</p>
<h4>
    <a name="cook"></a>
    Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
</h4>
<p>
    Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). Wishradio.in and its affiliated websites
    use cookies for the following general purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was
            visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to
            log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Keep me signed in on this
            computer unless I sign out.” Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for
            security purposes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To help us customize the content, website experience, and advertisements provided to you on our websites and on other websites across the Internet.
            For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as
            you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which
            e-mails you open and act upon).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you
    when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable non-essential types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to
    access some of the information offered on our sites.
</p>
<p>
    Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
    function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites
    to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party
    Web site, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened
    by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.
</p>
<h4>
    <a name="adv"></a>
    Display of Advertising/Your Choices
</h4>
<p>
    <em>Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising</em>
</p>
<p>
    Wishradio.in is committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your online
    shopping-related searches, such as when you search to buy a product or service online, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or
    elsewhere online that match your interests. So, for example, if you search for a “bag” on Wishradio.in, you may see an ad for a “bag” on Wishradio.in or on
    another website you visit.
</p>
<p>
    We do not share your personal contact information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</em>
</p>
<p>
    Many of the advertisements you see on the Wishradio.in are served by Wishradio.in or its service providers. But we may also allow third parties to collect
    information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information
    when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when
    you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties
    is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet
    tailored to your interests.
</p>
<p>
    We do not permit these third parties to collect personal contact information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any
    personal information about you.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your
    interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h4>
    <a name="loc"></a>
    <a name="call"></a>
    Call Recording and Monitoring.
</h4>
<p>
    Please be aware that calls to and from Wishradio.in may be recorded. We may use the call recordings to monitor our customer service for quality or
    compliance purposes, to check the accuracy of the information you provide us, for fraud prevention purposes, or to provide training to our staff. We will
    retain the call recordings for as long as reasonably necessary to perform such activities and then delete them. Any personal information obtained from you
    during the call will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

<h3>
    How we use your information
</h3>
<p>
    Wishradio.in uses the information we collect about you for the following general purposes: for registration and to manage your account, including to
    facilitate your access to and use of our site; to communicate with you in general, including to provide information about Wishradio.in and invitations from
    the Wishradio.in community; to enable us to publish your reviews, forum posts, and other content to the Wishradio.in community; to respond to your
    questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Web site; to notify you about special offers and products or
    services available from us or our partners that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with Wishradio.in; to solicit information
    from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our
    Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.
</p>
<p>
    If you have signed up as the owner or manager of an online store, we will send you e-mail messages at the email address you provide to us.
</p>
<h4>
    Email Communications.
</h4>
<p>
    We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of online shopping related opportunities on our website. One way we do this is by sending you email
    messages that contain information about your apparent shopping related interests. For example, if you search for a pair of shoes on our website, we may
    send you an email message about deals and offers on shoes. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about online shopping
    related special offers available through our site. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such
email we send. Please review "    <a href="{% url 'privacy_policy' %}#choi">Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information</a>" below to exercise
    your rights regarding email communications.
